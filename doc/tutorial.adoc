Tutorial
--------

Coroutines are resumable functions; regular functions get called once, and leave upon completion,
where as coroutine keep their state and can get resumed.

[source,cpp]
----
async::generator<int> example()
{
    printf("In coro 1\n");
    co_yield 2;    
    printf("In coro 3\n");
}

async::main co_main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
    printf("In main 0\n");
    auto f = example(); // call and let it run until the first co_yield
    printf("In main 2\n");
    co_await f;
    printf("In main 4\n");
    return 0;
}
----

Which will generate the following output

 In main 0
 In coro 1
 In main 2
 In coro 3
 In main 4

Notably, async provides a `co_main` entry point to make creating asynchronous applications easy.
