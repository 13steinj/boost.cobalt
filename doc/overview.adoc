Overview
--------

This library provides a set of easy to use coroutine utilities that are kept very simple by a few constraints.

Those are:

- `io_context` is the `execution_context` of choice.
- Every `asio::io_context` is single threaded
- Eager execution is the way to go

It takes a collection of concepts from other languages and ports them to use C++ coroutines.

 - easy asynchronous base functions, such as an async main & threads
 - promise & generator types
 - operation wrappers
 - an async finalizer
 - select
 - channels
