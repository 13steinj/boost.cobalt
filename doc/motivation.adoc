= Motivation

Many languages provide a simple programming languages like node.js and python provide easy to use
single-threaded concurrency frameworks.
While more complex than simple synchronous code,
single threaded asynchronicity avoids many of the pitfalls & overhead of multi-threading.

This library is meant to provide this to C++: simple single threaded asynchronicity
akin to node.js and asyncio in python.

It takes a collection of concepts from other languages and provides them based on  C++20 coroutines.

 - easy asynchronous base functions, such as an async main & threads
 - <<promise, promise>> & <<generator, generator>> types
 - operation wrappers
 - an async finalizer
 - <<select, select>>
 - <<channel, channel>>
