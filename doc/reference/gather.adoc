[#gather]
== async/gather.hpp

The `gather` function can be used to `co_await` multiple <<awaitable>>s at once with properly connected cancellations.

The function will gather all completion and return them as `system::result`,
i.e. capture conceptions as values. One awaitable throwing an exception will not cancel the others.

It can be called as a variadic function with multiple <<awaitable>> or as on a range of <<awaitable>>s.

[source,cpp]
----
async::promise<void> task1();
async::promise<void> task2();

async::promise<void> do_gather()
{
  co_await async::gather(task1(), task2()); // <1>
  std::vector<async::promise<void>> aws {task1(), task2()};
  co_await async::gather(aws); // <2>
}
----
<1> Wait for a variadic set of <<awaitable>>s
<2> Wait for a vector of <<awaitable>>s

The `gather` will invoke the functions of the `awaitable` as if used in a `co_await` expression.
