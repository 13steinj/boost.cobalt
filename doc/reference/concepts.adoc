=== Awaitable

An awaitable is an expression that can be used with `co_await`.

[source,cpp]
----
template<typename Awaitable, typename Promise = void>
concept awaitable_type = requires (Awaitable aw, std::coroutine_handle<Promise> h)
{
    {aw.await_ready()} -> std::convertible_to<bool>;
    {aw.await_suspend(h)};
    {aw.await_resume()};
};

template<typename Awaitable, typename Promise = void>
concept awaitable =
        awaitable_type<Awaitable, Promise>
    || requires (Awaitable && aw) { {std::forward<Awaitable>(aw).operator co_await()} -> awaitable_type<Promise>;}
    || requires (Awaitable && aw) { {operator co_await(std::forward<Awaitable>(aw))} -> awaitable_type<Promise>;};
----

WARNING: <<awaitable,awaitables>> in this library require that the coroutine promise
return their executor by const reference if they provide one. Otherwise it'll use `this_thread::get_executor()`.

[#enable_awaitables]
=== Enable awaitables

Inheriting `enable_awaitables` will enable a coroutine to co_await anything through `await_transform`
that would be `co_await`-able in the absence of any `await_transform`.
